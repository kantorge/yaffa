## About Yaffa

Yaffa is a personal finance web application, focusing on the support of long term financial planning. By hosting your own app instance, your financial data is not uploaded to the cloud, and shared with any third parties.

### Key existing features:
* Support multiple currencies, and option to mark the default one to be used on dashboards and charts
* Support multiple accounts and account groups
* Track your income and spending by recording transactions.
* Yaffa tries to come up with suggestions while creating transactions to speed up transaction recording process.
* Optionally, transactions can be split into categories, which helps budget planning
* Scheduled and recurring transactions and budgets (plans) can be created, which can be used to calculate forecasted data.
* Add your investments, to calculate gain and loss

**Please note:** the application can be used in production, but it's still under development. There are several features planned to be implemented:
* Automatic currency exchange rate updates from external sources.
* Further charts, reports and dashboards.
* Handling multiple teams/families in one app instance.
* Onboarding support or wizard
* QIF/CSV file imports

Several features are not likely to be introduced, which you might expect from such applications. If you are looking to have these, then Yaffa might not be the right choice for you.
* Downloading transaction data directly from banks
* Mobile app version (although the web interface is more or less responsive for mobile browser support)

## Key features
* Support multiple currencies.

  * Currency rates are automatically updated daily.
  * YAFFA utilizes the free Frankfurter service, requiring no API key or registration.
* Support multiple accounts and account groups.
* Track your income and spending by recording transactions.
  * Yaffa tries to come up with suggestions while entering transactions to speed up transaction recording process.
  * Transactions can be split into categories. This helps to better understand spending patterns and budget planning.
  * Yaffa can process receipts from emails and fill in transaction details automatically.
    * This feature is optional. It is based on OpenAI API. You need to register and pay for the service. 
      Also, you need to be able to receive emails on your own server. 
* Scheduled and recurring transactions, and budgets (plans) can be created.
  * This can be used to calculate forecasted data.
  * You can enable the automatic recording of recurring transactions.
* Add your investments, to calculate gain and loss.
  * Automatically retrieve investment prices.
  * This is based on the alphavantage.co service. You need to register and get your free API key.

There are several features **planned** to be implemented:
* Further charts, reports and dashboards.
* Handling multiple users as a family in one app instance.
* Better onboarding experience, or a tutorial.
* Flexible or universal QIF/CSV file imports
* Process receipts from images

Several features are **not likely to be introduced**, which you might expect from such applications.
If you are looking to have these in a budget app or expense tracker, then Yaffa might not be the best choice for you.
* Downloading transaction data directly from banks
  * The philosophy of expense tracking is to be conscious about your spending and financial habits, which requires the review and manual adjustment of transactions. 
    Thus, automatic downloading of transactions from banks would save some time, but would not help to achieve the goal of expense tracking and budgeting.
  * Also, YAFFA supports automatic creation of scheduled transactions and entry of simple recurring transactions, to speed up the process of recording transactions.
* Native mobile app 
  * Yaffa is optimized for desktop browsers, but the interface is responsive to support mobile view.
